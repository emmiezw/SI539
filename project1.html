        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In order to solve a problem I encountered during my research assistant work, I initiate researches, ideation and prototyping to envision a cross platform system for two distinguished user groups.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2019, after taking <strong>SI582 Introduction to Interaction Design </strong>and <strong>SI649 Information Visualization</strong>, I reopened this project based on user research results and refined the prototypes.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          I contacted 4 student researchers who took part in volunteer recruitment for research projects and 2 experiment volunteers of their ongoing projects. I conducted semi-structured interviews with researchers about the whole process and their feelings in different phases of managing the recruitment. I conducted interviews with volunteers about how they find out about these experiments and what are their key motivations in taking part in experiments.<br>
